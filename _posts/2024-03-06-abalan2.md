### If I perform non-linear dimensionality reduction on PCs, what happens when I vary how many PCs should I use?

I am visualizing the effect of performing tSNE on varying number of PCs. Similar to my homework 3 visualization I have visulaized the 
KRT7 gene expression in the reduced dimensionality space. The gene expression was normalized (by total gene 
expression for each cell) prior to PCA. t-SNE was then performed by using all PCs, first 30 PCs only, first 10 PCs only, first 4 PCs only and first 2PCs only. Using gganimate I have shown the transition of performing tSNE starting with all PCs 
and then reduced number of PCs. The animation helps emphasize the difference in the embeddings as we reduce the number of PCs.
