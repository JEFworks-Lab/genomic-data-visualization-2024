### Figure Description:
I animated the transition between two plots: one depicting the raw, unaltered data, and the other showcasing the data after normalization and log transformation. In the initial plot, where the data remains untouched, a conspicuous prevalence of "high" KRT7 expression is evident, denoted by a predominance of lighter blue. Conversely, in the normalized and transformed dataset, the prominence of "high" expression substantially diminishes, with the plot predominantly draped in darker blue, indicating lower expression levels. Though, this phenomenon also raises a crucial acknowledgement in a limitation of this approach:  the color gradient on the plots fails to precisely mirror the relative expression levels of KRT7 within each plot.

This is because even in the normalized dataset, pockets of "high" expression exist. However, when compared / animated with the raw dataset, these values register as "low" due to the normalization process. Despite this limitation though, the animated comparison effectively underscores the transformative impact of normalization and transformation on PCA outcomes, accentuating the nuanced alterations in expression profiles across datasets.

Some challenges remained unresolved with gganimate though, namely the ability to display the values of PC1 and PC2 on the respective axes and also the encoding of the label for KRT7.
