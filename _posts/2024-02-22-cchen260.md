## Your goal is to figure out what tissue structure is represented in the CODEX data. Options include: (1) Artery/Vein, (2) White pulp, (3) Red pulp, (4) Capsule/Trabecula
The tissue structure that I believe is represented in the CODEX data is a section of spleen tissue which include arteries and white pulp. I can come to this conclusion through the cell types that I identified in my data visualizations. I visualized clusters 2 and 3 of my tSNE embedding in panel (A). In cluster 2, CD8 was upregulated throughout the cluster (C) and had higher expression in the physical space around the spoon looking formation. I know that CD8 is a marker for CD8+ T cells (1) which are found mainly in the white pulp section of the spleen (2, 3). The white pulp portion of the spleen is where the majority of T cells and B cells are located (3), and looking at the expression of CD8+ T cells in panel (C), I can conclude that this section of spleen tissue contains portions of white pulp. 
In the other cluster I analyzed, I found an upregulation of CD31 in cluster 3, seen in panel (E). CD31 is also known as PECAM-1 (platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1)(4) and highly expressed in both leukocytes and endothelial cells which line the inner surface of blood vessels (5)(ie. arteries/veins). In physical space, we can also see that the CD31 is highly expressed in a little ring in the center of the 'spoon' structure. I hypothesize that this could represent a blood vessel/artery with a high population of endothelial cells. For these reasons, I can hypothesize that the section of spleen tissue represented in the data set contains portions of white pulp and arteries/veins based on interpreting my clusters in my data visualization as well as analyzing representations of the physical space.

### Reorganized the data a little bit
pos <- data[, 1:2]
area <- data[, 3]
gexp <- data[, 4:31]

### plot the x y coordinates and visualize area
df <- data.frame(pos, area)
ggplot(df) + geom_point(aes(x = x, y = y, col= area), size = 0.1)

### Limit the number of genes
# subset for faster processing
gexp <- gexp[, colSums(gexp) > 1000] ## highly expressed genes
# probably also normalize...
gexpnorm <- log10(gexp/rowSums(gexp) * mean(rowSums(gexp))+1)

### PCA
pcs <- prcomp(gexpnorm)
dim(pcs$x)

### tsne
emb <- Rtsne(pcs$x[,1:5])$Y


### Kmeans clustering and tsne plotting
