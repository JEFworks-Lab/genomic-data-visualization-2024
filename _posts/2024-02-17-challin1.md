## Write a description of what you changed and why you think you had to change it.
I am switching from the Eevee dataset to the Pikachu dataset for HW5. I was able to successfully identify the same cell-type in the Pikachu dataset as I did in the Eevee dataset. I had to change a bit of my code from HW4 to do this. I previously performed k-means clustering with k=5, now I performed k-means clustering with k=12. Although I checked the total withinness plot (showed cluster to 6 clusters at elbow), I decided to choose k=12 in hope to successfully extract the same cell-type as I did in HW4. Further, I think there would be a higher optimal number of transcriptionally distinct cell-clusters in the single-cell resolution Pikachu dataset compared to the spot-based Eevee dataset because the Pikachu dataset has more observations (being single-cell instead of spot resolution) thus leading to more transcriptional diversity. Another change I made was to use all genes instead of the top genes since there are only ~300 compared to ~18,000. I also added a small value to the p-value from the Wilcoxon Ranked Test to avoid a log(0). One neat thing I did was to add layers of ggplot so the points of interest are on top layer. This allows for the points to be seen more easily and not be plotted overtop of unimportant points (or the gray points in this figure).

For Homework 5, I am switching from the Eevee dataset to the Pikachu dataset. I was able to successfully identify the same cell-type in the Pikachu dataset as I did in the Eevee dataset, KRT6B, with some minor tweaks to my previous Homework 4 code. Originally, I was using k-means clustering with k=5, but this time around, I cranked it up to k=12. Even though the plot of total withinness suggested 6 clusters might be the sweet spot, I went with k=12 anyway, knowing it would help me find the same cell type I did before.

I believe that the Pikachu dataset, which offers single-cell resolution instead of Eevee's spot-based approach, will let us see more unique cell clusters because it has more observations to work with, which will likely lead to a richer variety of cell types, especially given multiple cell types may be contains in each Eevee spot. Another change I made was to analyze all genes instead of just focusing on the top ones since there are only around 300 genes to consider, which isn't as overwhelming compared to the massive list of about 18,000 genes the Eevee dataset has.

To deal with the log(0) situation, I added 10e-300 to the p-value for the two-sided Wilcoxon Rank Sum. Finally, one neat thing I did was to add layers of ggplot so the points of interest are on the top layer. This allows for the points to be seen more easily and not be plotted underneath of unimportant points (or the gray points in this figure).

#### Clustering ####

#### DE Gene Analysis ####

# do wilcox for DE genes
pv <- sapply(colnames(gexpnorm), function(i) {
    print(i) ## print out gene name
    wilcox.test(gexpnorm[clusters == 6, i], gexpnorm[clusters != 6, i])$p.val
})

head(sort(pv))

# get log fold change
logfc <- sapply(colnames(gexpnorm), function(i) {
    print(i) ## print out gene name
    log2(mean(gexpnorm[clusters == 6, i])/mean(gexpnorm[clusters != 6, i]))
})
